    1. Create new items with different priorities
    1. Delete a specific item
    1. Delete all items
    1. Change settings and check if they work
1. After you finish, *zip all your source code* and email us back *or* commit to a public github repository

### Extra points for:

1. Robot pattern
1. Usage of good code standards
1. Documentation
1. Kotlin (but remember, it's not necessary)
